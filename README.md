# minishell
Second project from Unix -branch in Hive Helsinki

Task was to create our own shell interpreter with C
and implement few built-ins, such as 'echo', 'cd',
'setenv', 'unsetenv' and 'exit'.

I concider that parsing was the hardest part, and 
i managed to handle it in the scope of the subject by
'trial and error' and asking around how other people did it.

Usage:

1. Clone the repository
```
https://github.com/MiikaViini/minishell.git
```

2. Compile the project
```
make
```

3. Run it
```
./minishell
```

NOTE! 
Program has been developed in Unix -environment so behaviour may vary 
in Linux distros.
